    <h1>Hello World! Writing to you from The Odin Project v2.0</h1>
    <h2>
      Similar the structures we see in our day-to-day <i>landscapes</i>, we need
      hierarchy of content in html
    </h2>
    <h3>For example, I am heading 3, heading 2 lies 2 lines above me.</h3>
    <p>Here's a random paragraph just so I understand how this works.</p>

    <h4>Now, let's try and understand spacing in HTML</h4>

    <p>
      Typically, when the browser encounters new lines in the HTML, it will
      compress them down into one single space. The result is that all of the
      text are then clumped together into one long line.
    </p>

    <p>
      Using the <b>paragraph</b> element allows for spacing in between
      paragraphs - just like so!
    </p>

    <p>
      So it seems like there are two ways to italicise words - <em>this</em> and
      <i>this</i> - I'm wondering how they look like.
    </p>

    <p>Let's test our <strong>this</strong> and <b>this</b></p>
